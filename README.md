# Grokking Algorithms workthrough

This repo is broken up into sections that mirror the chapters of the book, each section contains a "TO_IMPLEMENT" and "COMPLETED" version of the algorithm for that chapter, in both Ruby and Javascript.

## How to use this repo
Follow the Installation instructions below, navigate to the "to_implement" folder of the chapter that you want to practice, complete the TODO:s, and run tests as necessary to check your progress.

## Installation

First, clone this repo to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabrielbonner/grokking_algorithms.git
```

To run the Ruby tests you'll need to have the Rspec gem installed:
```bash
cd grokking_algorithms
gem install rspec
```

## Run tests
To run tests in Ruby use `ruby` + name_of_file.rb, for example:
```bash
cd grokking_algorithms/06-breadth_first_search/completed
ruby bfs-COMPLETED.rb
```

To run tests in Javascript use `node` + name_of_file.js, for example:
```bash
cd grokking_algorithms/06-breadth_first_search/completed
node bfs-COMPLETED.js
```
